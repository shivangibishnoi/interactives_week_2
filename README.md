## Project Proposals

Topic 1:
Why you’re interested in this topic: 
I created this dataset myself for a class project but I am interested in taking it up a notch.
Related dataset(s): 
Here is a link to the mapbox version and github repo: https://shivangibishnoi.github.io/NYT-Goodreads-Map/

Two proposed visualization ideas(written out or sketched):
I would like to have this map be interactive, allowing the user to click on the country/ region and see every bestselling author from that country for all years since 2011. 

What supplemental narrative elements will you include?
I’d also like to have the country color coded according to how many bestselling authors it has seen. 


Topic 2:
Why you’re interested in this topic: 
I wrote a long-form story last semester that has a data element. The narrative is fully fleshed out, only the visuals remain.  Here is the link: Is doing a PhD really worth it

Related dataset(s): 
Survey of Earned Doctorates


Two proposed visualization ideas(written out or sketched):
I wonder if I can use D3 force to show the changes in employment of doctoral students from academia to industry for each field?
Possibly a line or streamgraph with transitions
